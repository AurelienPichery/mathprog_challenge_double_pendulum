# mathprog_challenge_double_pendulum
This code is a Python double pendulum simulation code (which output a gif file).

## How does it works
We solve some mathematics equations and output 1001 coordinates for the 2 masses of the pendulums to animate it on a gif file for 40s (so 25 fps).
You can download the code and run it with an IDE after having installed the needed libraries:
- Numpy
- Sympy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
